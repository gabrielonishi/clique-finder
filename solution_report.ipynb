    "### Description\n",
    "The brute force approach to finding the maximum clique in a graph is a method that systematically explores all possible combinations of vertices to identify the largest complete subgraph, known as a clique. It starts with an initial vertex and iteratively adds vertices to a candidate clique, checking if the addition maintains the clique property. This exhaustive approach guarantees the optimality of the solution, but its computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of vertices, making it impractical for large graphs.\n",
